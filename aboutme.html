</div>
  <div><p> I have an extensive understanding of digital scholarship and data science, particularly concerning digital archives and misinformation. In the past three years, I have been a Lecturer in History and Data Science at Northeastern University London. You could say,  “Those who can, do; those who can't, teach”. Fair enough, but I also have research experience.

  <div class="fancy"><p>As a Research Fellow in Advanced Digital Methods (2020-2021) at the National Archives, my task was cleaning, visualising, and analysing the Operation War Diary dataset, which is an enormous, born-digital, crowdsourced annotation collection.
  <br>You can read about its challenges <a href="https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/research-exchange-interpretation-in-digital-research/>">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/the-challenges-of-working-on-the-operation-war-diary-records/">here </a>, and you can also <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/books/dhc2022/uncertainty-in-visualising-crowdsourced-history-mapping-the-operation-war-diary-data/">
      consult the first paper </a> published from this research. A second paper is on the way, which is going to be published in the edited volume Digital Ecology in Arts and Humanities: Epistemology, Aesthetics and Politics by Amsterdam University Press in 2024.</p></div>

      <div class ="fancy"><p>The Archive of Tomorrow Methods Fellowship was not my first encounter with researching misinformation.
        As a journalist, I was part of multimedia teams working on fake news, where we aimed at visualising and disseminating the problem via interactive platforms (like <a href="https://eymd2018.github.io/FakeNews/?fbclid=IwAR2NUe8dJd4wh1nBZCC3bvfsys5PNBbcSnFOkYNJp_eLMZYo9tkFJ_AzINU">here</a> and <a href="https://eymd2017.github.io/FakeNews/">here.)</a></p>

     It won the first prize in the first round of the Digital Futures category at the PresentIn10 competition, and we have two manuscripts in the drawer ready to be published.</p></div>

      <div class="fancy"><p>However, I don't stick only to digital archives and misinformation. In my most recent research, soon to be published in the International Handbook of Heritage and Affect by Routledge, I experimented with building an ontology for emotion detection for the heritage sector in order to overcome the bias built in crowdsourced dictionaries.
        I give an intro to the concepts and the problems <a href="https://youtu.be/pkIDEGV9zrc?si=gN1pYzjiQE9ZBsee">in this talk</a>.</p></div>

      <div class="fancy"><p>Besides research, I'm keen on Front-End development for the GLAM sector. I designed the digital outputs of the <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/events/unforgotten-lives-exhibition"> Unforgotten Lives exhibition of the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) </a>. As part of the Mapping Black London team, I was responsible for finding and re-telling stories of the pre-20th century ethnic diversity in London.
      I develpoed two digital components. Firstly, an ‘Interactive Map’ in the heart of the exhibition space allows users to interact with the Switching the Lens dataset, browse by parish, look up specific regions, and find people and places mentioned in the exhibition. Secondly, a smartphone walking application encourages the visitors to
        interact with the heritage of Black London after leaving the exhibition, extending it over the walls of the archives and directly exploring the city. The video shows its usage. Currently, I also have commissions for the interactive visualisation of the medieval Ely pilgrimage routes and for creating mobile apps for the community walks
        of the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. I would be absolutely thrilled to design apps for NLS.</p></div>

      <div><p>I can communicate. I have bachelor's and master's degrees in Communication and years of work experience as a journalist and institutional communicator. But then, I decided to dedicate my life to an academic career. However, I did not abandon the subject as a researcher either. I designed and teach the Research Communications module at Anglia Ruskin University, where students learn how to formulate their message, choose their audience and the matching format for their stories while acquiring technical skills for digital storytelling. I could put these skills into service for outreach at the NLS.
