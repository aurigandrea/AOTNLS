  <h1>1. Interactive web app and display screen to explore and play with the dataset</h1>

  <div class="fancy"><p>I love gamifying data as it makes even the most technical topic less intimidating. Imagine an interactive screen displayed at the Library where both children and adults can play drag-and-drop games to learn more about misinformation and explore the data set.<br>Want to access it from home? No problem. We can add it to the Data Foundry's website as well.</p>
  <p>I design and code websites quickly and have experience creating museum displays and interactive data visualisations.
 The image shows me and a display screen I coded for the London Metropolitan Archives. Would you like to <a href="https://heritagedigital.org/blog/2023%20-%2004%20-%2022%20-%20making-the-invisible-visible-again-unforgotten-lives-exhibition-at-lma/">learn more about it? </a></p></div>

  <h1>2. Jupyter notebooks to add to the Data Foundry notebook collection</h1>
    </div>
       <div class="flex-container3">
         <P>At the Digital Humanities Congress in 2022, I heard the  Data Foundry's representative discussing their initiative on providing the users with NLP scripts. I found the approach fascinating, and would be happy to contribute.</P>
<p>For those who would like to have a more profound engagement with the dataset, I would create Jupyter notebooks on how to rehydrate the articles from metadata and how to do some basic Topic Modelling on them. It can be especially useful while the BL dataset is unavailable.</p>

        <p>I have practice in giving workshops and teaching entry-level digital humanities skills. What if the users would explore the dataset while learning how to use easy software to analyse and visualise longer texts? It would kill two birds with one stone: we would spread awareness about the collection while bringing in those audiences who wish to bridge the digital literacy gap. In the image, it's me before a workshop like this at the Cambridge Digital Humanities.
